    <p>Tired of sitting at home twiddling your thumbs, eating Ramen noodles, and being sad about the recession?  Just in the nick of time, <b>WTD DC </b> is here.</p>  
    <p>We find awesome things for you and your friends to do in Washington DC and help you get out of the house to explore the city.  A restaurant? A spa? A show?  Maybe it's something really cool that you don't even know about.</p>
    <h4>How does WTD work?</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>We find fun things to do in the DC area and negotiate great discounts</li>
      <li>Each day a brand new deal is sent to our listserv and posted on our website</li> 
      <li>Users who want to buy the deal click the "Deal Me In" button and enter their billing info</li>	
      <li>As long as we line up the minimum number of purchasers, everyone gets the discount and credit cards are charged</li>

      <li>WTD sends your coupon via e-mail and you hit the town</li>
      <li>Check back every day for a new deal</li>

    </ol>
